## About The Project

This is a 2D Hunting game. It is only browser-based and built with Phaser 3 game engine. The player's job is to try to avoid a enemy attacks. So the player should keep smashing them as they get in close ranges. The main objective of the game is to keep the enemies at a distance and smash any that gets closer to the player. If more enemies appear in close range to the player, they overwhelm and defeat you.

For each enemy you smash, points will be added to your score. In the end, you will be added to the leaderboard if you come out among the best.


## How to play
When the game first starts;
* You are presented with the Title scene that has three buttons.
> Play button is to play the game.
> Options button directs you to the game settings
> Credits button directs to the game Inpirations and author

* With the play button, the next scene allows you to play the game as a guest, meaning that you don't have to input your name. Or Enter a a name and still play the game.

* Once the game starts on the next scene, 
> Use the right cursor key to smash through sprites and earn points/stars
> Use the arrow keys to navigate left, right, up and down.

* The  game over scene will list down all the scores of top users and your own score is displayed at the top.

* Reload the page to play again.
